A raw dataset in Excel format from the Amazon sales platform has been provided. Using this dataset, a Power BI dashboard needs to be developed with AI capabilities to enable comprehensive sales analytics.

So first I used Chatgpt to create the required column in the raw data excel sheet and later named(Amazon Raw Data Final Using AI) which will be using for preparing the Dasboard.

Prompt 1:
write an excel formula to give value "Delay", if the difference of dates between cell C2 and B2 is greater than 4, otherwise the value should be "On time"

Solution 1
=IF(C2 - B2 > 4, "Delay", "On time")

Prompt 2:
write an excel formula to extract name from email id in F2 with @ as a separator

Solution 2
=LEFT(F2, FIND("@", F2) - 1)

Prompt 3:
I have comma separated value in G2. Write 3 excel formula to extract the value as comma as a separator in H2, I2 and J2

H2
=TRIM(LEFT(G2, FIND(",", G2) - 1))

I2
=TRIM(MID(G2, FIND(",", G2) + 1, FIND(",", G2, FIND(",", G2) + 1) - FIND(",", G2) - 1))

J2
=TRIM(MID(G2, FIND(",", G2, FIND(",", G2) + 1) + 1, LEN(G2)))
